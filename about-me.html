  <h1>A little about me...</h1>
    <p>I'm a history nut who is slowly but surely turning into a web developer.  I've called Charlotte my home for 8 years, but in my heart I'll always be a Yinzer (or Pittsburgher, for those not fluent in Pittsburghese).<p>
    <p> I've always been fascinated by history in general, and American and Russian history in particular.  My pastimes include spending as much time as possible outdoors with my wife and my two dogs, and more recently, learning about web design and development.</p>

  <h1> What speaks to me?</h1>
    <p>Animal-welfare issues have always been important me, and I feel that every dog and cat should be lucky enough to live the happy and comfortable life that our dogs enjoy.</p>
    <p>I'm also involved with environmental issues; I'm lucky enough to live a short drive from the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains, and it's important that future generations be able enjoy them as well one day.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm from:</h1>
    <p>As mentioned, I was born and raised in Pittsburgh.  I would recommend to anyone that they visit the city if they ever have the chance; it's a place of great cultural diversity and the view of the city from Mount Washington is not to be missed.  It's amazing to see how the city has been revitalized in recent years after the decline of Big Steel.</p>

  <h1>More about me...</h1>
  <h2>Hobbies, pastimes, and other amusements:</h2>
    <p>My hobbies include anything that will get me outdoors, like camping, hiking, and even sport rowing.  On the rainy days I enjoy brewing beer and reading about places I'd love to visit one day as travel is very high on my list as well.  I've traveled all over North America and parts of Europe.</p>
  
  <h2>My dream job:</h2>
    <p>I would love to one day develop and design websites for organizations that support causes I believe in.  Or travel websites, where my palette can consist of the rich scenes and colors of different cultures and places.</p>
  
  <h2>The soundtrack to my life:</h2>
    <p>Classic rock has always been my bread and butter, but lately I've been trying a little of everything.  When working at my computer I like the relaxed tones of downtempo and indie/folk rock artists.</p>
